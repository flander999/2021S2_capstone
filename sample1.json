        "text": "Results: Both the collagenase and LAP were present in the body wall; however, they differ in their distribution pattern in\ndifferent layers of body wall. Collagenase was mainly localized in epicuticle, cuticle, syncytial hypodermis and the nerve cord\nregion whereas LAP was more concentrated in epicuticle, longitudinal muscle layers and almost absent or very faintly stained in\nsyncytial hypodermis and nerve cord region. Both collagenase and LAP showed their common distributions in intestine, uterus\nand mature eggs, growing embryos and mf. Very strong immunostaining of collagenase in the outer body surface of the parasite\nindicates its major role in host-parasite relationship whereas the presence of LAP in muscular region suggests its role in tissue\nremodeling. The common presences of collagenase and LAP in the S. cervi intestine, ovary, uterus, eggs and mf suggest that they\nalso have collaborative roles in molting, nutrition and embryogenesis. The data obtained on their immunological\ncharacterizations and their presence in important parasite organs give strong indication that they are critical for the survival of\nfilarial parasite and thus can be good vaccine candidates and/or diagnostic markers for human lymphatic filariasis.\n",

Setaria cervi\nis a bovine filarial parasite and serves as a good parasite model for the studies in lymphatic filariasis. Recently, a 175 kDa\ncollagenase and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) have been purified and characterized from the bovine filarial parasite S. cervi and\nshown to be potential vaccine candidate and diagnostic marker, respectively for human lymphatic filariasis. However, their tissue\nlocalizations and putative roles in the parasite biology have not yet been examined and thus remain unclear. Therefore, the\ncurrent study attempts to localize and explore the putative roles of these two enzymes in S. cervi.\n",

Therefore, to address the potential in vivo\nroles of collagenase and LAP, it would be helpful to estab-\nlish their precise locations in the parasite tissues. Reports\non tissue localization of collagenase in filarial and other\nhelminth parasites are scanty. However, tissue localiza-\ntion of related metallo-, cysteine and acidic proteases have\nbeen carried out in various filarial (1,3] and non-filarial\nparasites [18-20] and have shown their presence mainly\non intestinal microvilli, cuticle, hypodermis, ovary, uteri,\nand periphery of eggshell and growing embryos. On the\nother hand, LAP has been detected, purified and charac-\nterized in many other related parasites eg in F. hepatica\n[21], Ascaris suum [22-24], Schistosoma mansoni and S.\njaponicum [25,26]. In case of F. hepatica, the enzyme was\nlocalized to the cells of the gut epithelium of adult flukes\n[21]. Immunolocalisation studies in S. mansoni showed\nthat LAP was localized in the gastrodermal cells surround-\ning the gut lumen and surface tegument and eggs [25,26].\n",

Being a bovine parasite, its\nuse as the parasite model is not restricted by the inherent\nethical and practical limitations associated with humans\nand therefore serve as a good model parasite for the stud-\nies in lymphatic filariasis. Recently, two metalloproteases:\na 175 kDa collagenase and leucine aminopeptidase (LAP).\nhave been purified and characterized from adult female S.\ncenvi in authors' laboratory. The S. cervi collagenase was\nshown to have important roles in host immune evasion\nand immunoprotection. This enzyme specifically cleaved\nhuman IgG in vitro and was inhibited by the antibodies\nraised against it in jirds. The enzyme also showed a very\nhigh cross-reactivity with putatively immune human sera\ncollected from filarial endemic zones [13,14| and showed\nantigenic similarity to Brugia malayi [Unpublished obser-\nvation]. Both in vitro antibody dependent cell mediated\ncytotoxicity (ADCC) assay |15] and vaccine trial carried\nout in jirds against B. malayi using purified collagenase\nsuggested it to be an effective vaccine candidate against\nhuman lymphatic filariasis (Unpublished observation].\n",

Finally the counterstained sections were\ntreated through the graded alcohols, xylene and mounted\nin DPX for permanent slide preparation.
